Agent-Based Model of the UK Housing Market
==========================================

This is an agent-based model of the UK housing market written by the Institute of New Economic Thinking at the
University of Oxford, in collaboration with the Bank of England. It is intended for use as a tool for informing central
bank regulation policy.

The model incorporates owner-occupiers, renters, buy-to-let investors, a housing market, a rental market, banks, a
central bank and a government. A more detailed description of the model can be found at this
[Bank of England Working Paper](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Pages/workingpapers/2016/swp619.aspx) and at the
ModelDescriptionFeb16.pdf file.
